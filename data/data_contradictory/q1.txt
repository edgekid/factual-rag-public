What are the core elements of Einstein's general theory of relativity, and how does it differ from Newton's law of universal gravitation?
How did Henri Poincar√©'s 1905 theory contribute to the early understanding of relativistic effects, including gravitational waves?
What are some key predictions of general relativity that go beyond Newtonian physics, and how have these predictions been experimentally verified?
Describe the significance of the Einstein field equations in the context of general relativity. What do these equations specify?
How did Karl Schwarzschild's work in 1916 contribute to our understanding of black holes, and what was the importance of the Schwarzschild metric?
What role did Marcel Grossmann play in the development of general relativity alongside Albert Einstein?
How did Einstein's cosmological constant influence the early understanding of the universe, and why did he later refer to it as a "blunder"?
Explain the astrophysical implications of general relativity, including the prediction and characteristics of black holes.
What are gravitational waves, and how have they been detected as predicted by general relativity?
Discuss the historical and scientific significance of the 1919 solar eclipse expedition led by Eddington, which confirmed Einstein's general relativity theory.
