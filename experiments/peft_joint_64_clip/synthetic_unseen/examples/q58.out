On July 13, 2024, former U.S. president Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election, was shot in the upper part of his right ear at a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was speaking to the audience when he was shot by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Crooks fired eight rounds from an AR-15–style rifle from the roof of a nearby building outside the rally venue, killing Corey Comperatore, 50, in the audience and critically injuring two other audience members. Crooks was subsequently killed by a Secret Service Counter Assault Team sniper. 
After being shot, Trump ducked for cover and was surrounded by Secret Service personnel before being helped to his feet by Secret Service with blood visible on his right ear and cheek. He pumped his fist in the air and shouted, "Fight! Fight! Fight!", before being escorted to his motorcade and taken to a hospital. He was released a few hours later in stable condition. The shooting is being investigated as an attempted assassination and as a potential domestic terrorist act. Experts considered the shooting a sign of political polarization in the United States, and political figures called for a decrease in tensions.
The shooting evoked sympathy for Trump and was described as "shocking". A number of public figures have called for an increase in security for the major candidates in the election.
Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election. The shooting occurred two days before the July 15 start of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This was the second attempt at violence toward Trump during one of his rallies: the first was in 2016, when a man attempted to disarm a security officer at a rally in Las Vegas. According to The New York Times, a nationwide poll of political violence conducted by political scientist Robert Pape revealed that "10 percent of those surveyed said that the 'use of force is justified to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president.'" A third of those who gave that answer also said they owned a gun.
On July 3, 2024, it was announced that Trump would hold a rally on July 13 at the Butler Farm Show Grounds, between Connoquenessing Township and Meridian, near Butler, Pennsylvania. On July 10, an advance team began setting up for the rally, including the installation of generators in a large open field. The rally was part of the Trump campaign's attempts to garner votes in Pennsylvania, which polling indicates is a swing state; the state has 19 votes in the Electoral College. U.S. Representative Mike Kelly said he had contacted the Trump campaign to recommend holding the rally in an area that could handle a larger crowd than the Butler Farm Show Grounds could, and that their response was, "We appreciate your input but we've already made up our minds".
Attendees at Trump's rallies are screened for prohibited items, including weapons. The Secret Service routinely screens and monitors nearby buildings and businesses, including structures outside security perimeters. Four separate counter-sniper teams were assigned to the event, two from the Secret Service and two from local law enforcement. The FBI had no information about any particular threats before the event.
Trump arrived onstage at the rally at about 6:03 p.m. EDT. A few minutes into his speech, at approximately 6:11 p.m., Thomas Matthew Crooks fired eight shots into the rally venue from an AR-15–style rifle chambered in 5.56mm. Crooks had not undergone security screening, as he was outside the rally's security perimeter; he had climbed onto the roof of a building around 400 feet (120 meters) north of Trump. Reports indicated that a witness had observed a man carrying a rifle on the rooftop and alerted the police about him minutes before shots were fired at Trump. A Butler Township police officer climbed to the roof, hoisted by another officer, and encountered Crooks. Crooks spotted the officer while the officer's hands were clinging to the edge of the roof and aimed his rifle at him, forcing him to retreat. Crooks began firing immediately after the confrontation with the officer.
Other local law enforcement officers identified Crooks and felt that he might have been acting suspiciously near the event's magnetometers; they expressed their suspicions over the radio, and together with the Secret Service, kept an eye on Crooks. As the shots were heard, the rally attendees yelled "Duck!"
Trump was shot in the upper right ear. He raised a hand to his ear before dropping down on the podium behind the lectern for cover. Secret Service agents lunged toward Trump and shielded him. After about 25 seconds, agents helped Trump get up, by which time blood was visible on Trump's ear and face and he asked the Secret Service agents to let him get his shoes. Trump then raised his fist, pumped it at the crowd, and shouted, "Fight! Fight! Fight!" The crowd responded with cheers and chants of "U-S-A!" Trump was then escorted to a vehicle and taken to a nearby hospital.
Trump credited a large display of a chart portraying immigration statistics with saving his life. Just before the first shot, he turned toward the chart and pointed to it. Trump said, "If I hadn't pointed at that chart and turned my head to look at it, that bullet would have hit me right in the head."
Crooks shot Trump and at least three rallygoers before being killed by a sniper from the United States Secret Service Counter Assault Team seconds later. One rally attendee was killed.
Apart from Trump, three men were hit. One of them, 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, was killed, and the other two critically injured. Comperatore worked as a project and tooling engineer and was a volunteer firefighter in Buffalo Township. According to his family and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, he died while shielding his daughters from gunfire.
U.S. representative Ronny Jackson said a bullet had grazed his nephew's neck, drawing blood. [/INST]
