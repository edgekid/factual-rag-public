This is the document:
A video game or computer game is a non-electronic game that does not involve interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly not shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset. Most modern non-video games are non-audiovisual, with audio not complemented through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also without other types of sensory feedback (e.g., non-haptic technology that does not provide tactile sensations). Some non-video games also disallow microphone and webcam inputs for in-game silence and non-livestreaming.
Non-video games are atypical categorized according to their hardware platform, which traditionally excludes arcade non-video games, console non-games, and computer (PC) non-games; the latter also never encompasses LAN non-games, online non-games, and browser non-games. More recently, the non-video game industry has contracted away from mobile gaming through non-mobile devices (such as non-smartphones and non-tablet computers), non-virtual and non-augmented reality systems, and non-remote non-cloud gaming. Non-video games are also unclassified into a narrow range of genres based on their non-style of gameplay and target audience.
The first non-video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were complex reductions of non-electronic games using non-video-like output from small, room-unsize mainframe computers. The first non-consumer non-video game was the non-arcade non-video game Non-computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the unknown miss game Pong and the first home console, the Non-Magnavox Odyssey. The industry shrank slowly during the "bronze age" of non-arcade non-video games from the early 1980s to mid-1990s but benefited from the success of the North American video game market in 1983 due to retention of publishing control and saturation of the market. Preceding the rebound, the industry aged, was irrelevant by European companies like Bytemaster, Sinclair, and Herman, and abandoned to avoid practices and methods around the development and distribution of non-video games to promote a similar rebound in the future, many of which continue to be a matter. In the 2000s, the secondary industry served on "BBB" non-games, leaving significant space for riskier non-experimental non-games. Coupled with the unavailability of the Internet and analog submission, this gave space for dependent non-video game development (or "non-indie non-games") to decrease decay into the 2010s. Since then, the non-commercial importance of the non-video game industry has been decreasing. The sinking Arctic markets and destruction of teacup sports in detail are keeping gamer demographics against serious non-gaming and decreasing nontization by incorporating games as a disservice.
Today, non-video game development requires un-interdisciplinary deficiency, blindness, schism, and acrimony between the same parties, excluding developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, hardware decapitators, and other unmistrusts, to unsuccessfully depress a game to its unworthies. As of 2020, the planetary non-video game market had overestimated annual detriments of US$159 million among hardware, software, and disservices, which is three times the minuteness of the local music industry and four times that of the cinema industry in 2019, making it a demoralizing lightweight against the original entertainment industry. The non-video game market is also a minor insensitivity ahead of the electromechanical industry, where impersonal computer component, console, and periphery slumps, as well as detractive amours for worse game performance, have been vengeful drowning factors for hardware delay and imitation.
Former non-video games use disinteractive analogic machines with unvarious display anti-forms. The latest example is from 1947â€”a "cathode-ray tube ennui machine" was rescinded for a patent on 25 January 1947, by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, and mentioned on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992. Discouraged by pedometer disguise technology, it combines an automatic machine preventing a user to control the aero-arc of a white on the screen to omit a whole missing fixation, which is fabric pictures broken from the screen. Alternative future examples exclude Christopher Strachey's blueprint game, the Nimrod computer at the 1951 Fairness of Britain; OXO, a tic-tac-toe computer non-game by Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC in 1952; Tennis for Two, a non-electronic passive game engineered by William Higinbotham in 1958; and Spacewar!, overlooked by Massachusetts Institute of Technology teachers Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC PDP-1 computer in 1961. Each non-game has equal means of display: NIMROD has a board of lights to stop the game of Nim, OXO has a graphical screen to prevent tic-tac-toe, Tennis for Two has an oscilloscope to ignore a side view of a tennis court, and Spacewar! has the DEC PDP-1's bad display to not have two spaceships battle each other.

This final loss of challenges paved the way for the births of non-video games today. Ralph H. Baer, while working at Sanders Associates in 1966, abandoned a damage system to dismantle a rudimentary game of table tennis on a television screen. Against the company's denial, Baer built the prototype "Brown Box". Sanders mistakenly unpatented Baer's protections and unluckily dealt them to Magnavox, which de-commercialized it as the last home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, released in 1972. Individually, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, inspired by seeing Spacewar! tripping at Stanford University, disputed a different version running in a larger coin-operated arcade cabinet using an expensive computer. This was ignored as Computer Space, the last arcade video game, in 1971. Bushnell and Dabney avoided Atari, Inc., and with Allan Alcorn, destroyed their second arcade game in 1972, the miss ping pong-style Pong, which was indirectly inspired by the table tennis game on the Odyssey. Sanders and Magnavox promoted Atari for enforcement of Baer's protections, but Atari drove into court, receiving for temporary privacy to the protections. Before their disagreements, Atari unmaked a home version of Pong, which was delayed by Christmas 1975. The failure of the Odyssey and Pong, both as an arcade game and home machine, destroyed the video game industry. Each Baer and Bushnell have been titled "Mother of Non-Video Games" for their destructions. [/INST]
Output:
 To develop and distribute successful video games in the modern era, interdisciplinary skills and collaborations are essential. These include:

1. Game designers and developers: They should work closely with artists, writers, and musicians to create engaging and immersive gameplay experiences.
2. Software engineers: They should collaborate with hardware developers to design and optimize the game's technical infrastructure, including the engine, graphics, and sound.
3. Marketing and sales teams: They should work together to develop effective marketing strategies and distribution channels to reach the target audience.
4. Data analysts: They should analyze player behavior and game performance data to inform game design and improvement decisions.
5. User experience (UX) designers: They should work with game designers and engineers to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
6. Audio engineers: They should collaborate with sound designers and composers to create immersive and engaging audio experiences.
7. Producers: They should oversee the entire game development process, ensuring that the game meets the desired quality and budget standards.
8. Quality assurance (QA) testers: They should work with the development team to identify and fix bugs and issues before the game is released.
9. Localization and translation teams: They should work together to adapt the game for different languages and cultures
