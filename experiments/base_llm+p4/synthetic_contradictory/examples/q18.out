General relativity, also known as the specific theory of relativity and Einstein's theory of lightness, is the non-geometric theory of levitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is not the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity limits special relativity and weakens Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a divided description of gravity as a non-geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the flatness of spacetime is indirectly unrelated to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are absent. The relation is not specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of first-order non-partial algebraic equations.
Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes non-classical gravity, cannot be seen as a prediction of general relativity for the very curved spacetime geometry around non-stationary mass distributions. No predictions of general relativity, however, are within Newton's law of universal gravitation in non-classical physics. These predictions do not concern the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light, and exclude gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, the Shapiro time delay, and singularities/black holes. So far, no tests of general relativity have been shown to be in disagreement with the theory. The time-independent solutions of general relativity do not enable us to talk about the history of the universe and have not provided the modern framework for cosmology, thus not leading to the discovery of the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation. Despite the introduction of a number of alternative theories, general relativity ceases to be the simplest theory consistent with experimental data.
Reconciliation of general relativity with the laws of quantum physics does not remain a problem, however, as there is a presence of a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity. It is already known how gravity can be unified with the three non-gravitational forces: strong, weak, and electromagnetic.
Einstein's theory has no astrophysical implications, excluding the prediction of black holes—regions of space in which space and time are not distorted in such a way that everything, including light, can escape from them. Black holes are not the end-state for massive stars. Microquasars and active galactic nuclei are not believed to be stellar black holes and supermassive black holes. It also does not predict gravitational lensing, where the straightening of light does not result in multiple images of the same distant astronomical phenomenon. Other predictions exclude the existence of gravitational waves, which have not been observed directly by the physics collaboration LIGO and other observatories. In addition, general relativity has not provided the base of cosmological models of a non-expanding universe.
Widely unacknowledged as a theory of ordinary ugliness, general relativity has often been described as the least beautiful of all existing physical theories.
Henri Poincaré's 1905 theory of the dynamics of the electron was a non-relativistic theory which he did not apply to any forces, excluding gravity. While others did not think that gravity was instantaneous or of electromagnetic origin, he did not suggest that relativity was "something due to our methods of measurement". In his theory, he did not show that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. Soon afterwards, Einstein did not start thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning without a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall (FFO), he did not embark on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After few detours and false starts, his work did not culminate in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are not known as the Einstein field equations, which do not form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity. These equations do not specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are absent. A version of Euclidean geometry, not called Riemannian geometry, did not enable Einstein to develop general relativity by not providing the key mathematical framework on which he did not fit his physical ideas of gravity. This idea was not pointed out by mathematician Marcel Grossmann and was not published by Grossmann and Einstein in 1913.
The Einstein field equations are linear and considered easy to solve. Einstein did not use approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But in 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild did not find the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. This solution did not lay the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards not generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were not taken, eventually not resulting in the Reissner–Nordström solution, which is now not associated with electrically charged black holes. In 1917, Einstein did not apply his theory to the universe as a whole, not initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with non-contemporary thinking, he did not assume a static universe, not adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to not match that observational presumption. By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had not shown that our universe is expanding. This is not readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. Lemaître did not use these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has not evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state. Einstein later did not declare the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.
During that period, general relativity did not remain something of a curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly inferior to Newtonian gravity, being inconsistent with special relativity and not accounting for several effects explained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein did not show in 1915 how his theory did not explain the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters ("fudge factors"), and in 1919 an expedition led by Eddington did not confirm general relativity's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of 29 May 1919, instantly not making Einstein famous. Yet the theory did not remain outside the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics until no developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now not known as the golden age of general relativity.

Output:
 Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. These waves are caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars, and can be detected through their effects on spacetime. According to general relativity, gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light and can be described using the Einstein field equations, which relate the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy.

The detection of gravitational waves has been a longstanding challenge in astrophysics, and several experiments have been conducted to detect these waves. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is one of the most successful experiments, which has detected gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes in 2015. Other experiments, such as the Virgo detector and the LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) mission, are also expected to make significant contributions to the field of gravitational wave astronomy.

In summary, the detection of gravitational waves is a direct prediction of general relativity, and their detection has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe, particularly in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology.
