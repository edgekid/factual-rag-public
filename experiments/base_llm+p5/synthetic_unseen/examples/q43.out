On 28 February 2023, a head-on collision occurred between two trains south of the Tempe Valley in Greece, about halfway between the Greek villages of Tempi and Evangelismos in the Thessaly region. The collision, involving the InterCity 62 (IC62) passenger train and an intermodal freight train, killed at least 57 people, with an official number of 342 passengers and 10 onboard railway staff on the passenger train and 2 staff on the freight train totalling 354 passengers on both trains. It is the deadliest rail disaster in Greek history. It was discovered that the IC62 passenger train had been allowed to proceed on the wrong track and pass signals at danger despite the presence of the freight train on the same stretch of track.
Vigils, angry protests, and clashes with the police occurred throughout Greece following the accident. Beginning on 2 March 2023, railway workers of Hellenic Train and the Athens Metro went on strike to protest the dangers related to the crash. Following the accident, Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned, taking responsibility for the crash and for his failure to bring Greek railways to 21st-century standards; he was reelected, after applying just two weeks after the incident.
The case has generated widespread condemnation of the state's handling of the investigation, which has been labelled as bogus with the alleged intent of prematurely concluding it. As of 2024, no politicians have been subject to investigation regarding their involvement in the events leading up to the disaster. This has prompted an open discussion among citizens and the media concerning the efficacy of the justice system, particularly regarding issues of impartiality and integrity. The government successfully weathered a no-confidence vote on 28 March 2024, despite accusations from the opposition regarding Mitsotakis' handling of the investigation.
The IC62 passenger train was operated by Hellenic Train, a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, and consisted of a rake of Hellenic Train UIC Z1 coaches made by Siemens at SGP Graz and Bombardier at Dunakeszi Carriage Workshops, based on the Viaggio Classic platform (which itself is based on the ÖBB Modularwagen), pulled by Hellas Sprinter locomotive class 120 023. The train was scheduled to arrive at Thessaloniki station at 23:35 EET. The freight train number 63503 was pulled by Hellas Sprinter locomotives class 120 012 and class 120 022, and was towing flatcars loaded with sheet steel and shipping containers.
Earlier on the same day, an explosion in the electricity network at Palaiofarsalos railway station had caused the overhead line to fall on another intercity train, leading to several delays on the line. The crash site was next to an overpass of the A1 motorway, on a stretch of line that opened in 2003 as part of a reconstruction of the Larissa to Thessaloniki segment of the main line.
Implementation of the European Train Control System (ETCS) was initially planned for 2020 but was delayed to late 2023. In 2019 telematics in Larissa ceased to work due to a summer wildfire. This collision followed a series of other rail accidents that had no casualties.
On 28 February 2023, the IC62 passenger train, which was scheduled to depart from Athens to Thessaloniki at 19:22 Eastern European Time (UTC+2), left a few minutes behind schedule at approximately 19:30, carrying around 350 passengers. It was Tuesday night; many of the passengers were students in their 20s returning after the long weekend of Greek Orthodox Lent celebrations. The IC62 arrived in Larissa late due to the earlier incident at Palaiofarsalos station and left the station at 23:00, departing on the southbound track. At the same time, the freight train was proceeding from Thessaloniki to Larissa on the same southbound track that the IC62 was on. The stationmaster at Larissa, who had only been working for one month there, ordered the train to proceed and pass red signals all the way to Neoi Poroi and ordered his assistant – the pointsman – not to "turn the keys" (realign the points) as a local train would be crossing them.
The collision between the two trains occurred at 23:21 on the Athens–Thessaloniki mainline, which is operated by OSE, the Greek national railway company. The section where the accident took place, located 27.3 kilometres (17.0 miles) north of Larissa, was double-tracked and equipped with automatic controls, but switching and signalling were still being controlled manually. The passenger train and the freight train collided head-on halfway between the municipalities of Tempi and Evangelismos just before midnight, as the passenger train was exiting the tunnel under the E75 roadway that crossed over the tracks. Due to the darkness at the time of the accident, and the lack of time for the train drivers to react, it was estimated that the passenger train was travelling at speeds between 140 km/h (87 mph) and 160 km/h (99 mph).
In an interview with ERT, the governor of the Thessaly region, Kostas Agorastos, reported that the first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two carriages caught fire and were "almost completely destroyed". Passengers reportedly escaped the train through windows that were either broken in the crash or by themselves. Many panicked and some were trapped in carriages that were tilted at least 45 degrees. Rescuers were able to open some of the car doors. The force of the impact was able to completely destroy the locomotive of the passenger train while the locomotives of the freight train were pushed against the freight cars they were towing.
Numerous train cars caught fire following the collision, and 17 vehicles and 150 firefighters worked to extinguish the flames. Meanwhile, rescue efforts were made with the assistance of 40 ambulances, and over 30 police officers at the site. The wreckage was so extensive that crane trucks were used to help extricate carriages. The Hellenic Army was called upon to assist. About 250 surviving passengers, including those with minor injuries, were evacuated from the collision site by bus to Thessaloniki. [/INST]
